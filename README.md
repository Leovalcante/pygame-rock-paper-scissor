# Pygame - Rock, paper, scissor

Code from [Python Online Multiplayer Game Development Tutorial](https://youtu.be/McoDjOCb2Zo)

I made a few additions:

- Secure Socket connection using TLS ([Read this before running the code](./ssl/README.md))
- Safer pickle deserialization (this scares the shit out of me in any case)
